"""`cairn link [<project-repo>]` — pair a project repo with a cairn.

Writes a ``cairn.toml`` at the project repo root so agents working inside
the project repo can discover the paired cairn via cwd-walk. See ADR-0006
and ADR-0010.

Two modes:
- ``--name <cairn-name>`` (preferred): looks up the cairn in the user's
  MCP registry. Run from anywhere — typically inside the project repo.
- No ``--name`` (path-based fallback): resolves the cairn from cwd-walk.
  Run from inside the cairn directory.
